      <h4>Our mission</h4>
        <p>         
            We all heard about the damage made to the environment because of the leftovers of humans specially plastique which is one of the biggest reason for the death of sea turtels and marine life and also since it's a highly stable molecules it takes millions of years for it fully disappear in an other meaning this problem won't solve it self if we leave it as it is so what shall we do ? simply we can begin step by step reducing plastique waste by collecting it bit by bit and then recycling it in to more useful things until we clean our environment .
